Random Walk(lazy or not) on undirected graph, converges to a trivial distribution: pi(i) = degree(i)/(2|E|). Note that in our former project, the better set of PR computes on the undirected version. We can test the ROC of pi(i), and compare it with PR(not PPR).

How to handle rank leakage problem?
   * For single dangling node, a self loop can be added. (It's possible to become sink now). 
   * Any single node or a set of node forming strongly connected components with no out-going links is a sink. In stationary distribution, probability will focus on these sinks. Reverse links can be added to alleviate the problem, which induces the undirected version of original graph. 
   * To deal with sinks, introducing supernode also works. What's more, the introduction of super node increases computation complexity by a trivial amount.
