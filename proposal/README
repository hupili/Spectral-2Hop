This proposal was originally written to collect things I could think of 
that are related the 2hop community detection problem. Most of them, 
together with those recorded in the 'memo.txt' file will be tried out 
later. To fit into the course requirement, I focus on one point after 
a breath based survey. I choose spectral clustering at last. Now I output
a survey of spectral clustering as in depth as I can. The original proposal 
is moved here to avoid file collision.
